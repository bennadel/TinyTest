	Your unit tests will show up here. Using the rendered interface, you'll be able 
	to run all your unit tests; or, you can run one test case at a time.
	
	The Tiny Test framework will look for you tests in the "./specs/" directory located
	within this directory. In the specs directory, there is a TestCase.cfc component in
	which you can add custom assert methods for your test cases.

	NOTE: Look at the Application.cfc to see how to set up a mapping to the components
	that you are unit testing.
