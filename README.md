# Tiny Test - ColdFusion Unit Testing Framework

by [Ben Nadel][1]

This is a ColdFusion unit testing framework that I built for personal use as a means to
become more comfortable with the idea of unit testing and TDD (Test Drive Development).
The feature is set is intended to be incredibly limited; and, it's meant to work with an
HTML page that comes pre-packaged with the framework. You drop it in, point it to the 
test specifications, and open in the browser.
